# R Markdown and frontend workshop

In this workshop, we explored the R Markdown
software up to an intermediate level, besides some
packages which complement it, such as Bookdown,
Shiny and htmlwidgets. 

We also covered an introduction to HTML, CSS and
JavaScript, due to the recurring issue while working
with R Markdown, that some problems lack 
general solutions via R Markdown, but can be solved
thanks to having some basic frontend knowledge.
